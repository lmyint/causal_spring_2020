# d-separation (Part 2)

## Learning Goals {-}

1. Practice d-separation ideas with more examples

## Why care? {-}

In adjusting for variables in our analysis, we want to "do no harm":

- Block non-causal paths that generate unwanted associations
- Do not accidentally create non-causal paths that generate unwanted associations
- Leave causal paths (chains) alone

## Example: Folic Acid and Birth Defects {-}

Does maternal folic acid supplementation reduce the risk of birth defects? Or could associations be due to confounding factors? What should we adjust for in our analysis?

## Example: Estrogens and Uterine Cancer {-}

Does postmenopausal estrogen supplementation (hormone replacement therapy) cause uterine cancer?

- Consistent association between estrogen use and uterine cancer was noticed in the 1970s
- Two hypotheses:
    1. Estrogens do cause cancer
    2. Estrogens don't cause cancer but lead to uterine bleeding, leading to more frequent doctor visits, leading to increased diagnosis of existing cancer
- Proposal for a study: restrict the study only to those with uterine bleeding and compare cancer rates in estrogen-users and non-users
    - In this way, all participants have the same chance of being diagnosed.
    - What could be wrong about this approach?
    - Can we design a better study?

Causal diagrams corresponding to the two hypotheses:

Work through the following questions in your groups:

1. Consider the study proposal: restrict analysis to those with uterine bleeding.
    - Argue that under DAG 1, estrogens and diagnosed cancer will be associated.
    - Argue that under DAG 2, estrogens and diagnosed cancer will be associated.
    - Thus conclude that this study proposal cannot distinguish between the two competing hypotheses.
2. Consider another study proposal: ensure that *everyone* is screened frequently, and we don't restrict our analysis to only those with uterine bleeding.
    - What arrow (in either DAG 1 or 2) can be removed as a result of this study design?
    - In this study, say that we don't find an association between estrogens and diagnosed cancer? What does this mean about paths from estrogens to diagnosed cancer?
    - In this study, say that we do find an association between estrogens and diagnosed cancer? What does this mean about paths from estrogens to diagnosed cancer?
    - Based on these investigations, make a conclusion about the quality of this study proposal as compared to the first.

## Principles of building causal diagrams {-}

A DAG is a **causal DAG** if it is **common cause-complete**: for any two variables in the DAG, common causes (whether measured or unmeasured) of those variables are shown.

- A causal DAG does **NOT** need to be **cause-complete** (infeasible due to infinite regress of causes).
- It **should** contain variables that are selected on, and subsequently common causes between those variables and existing variables.
