["introductions-review-and-motivation.html", "Topic 1 Introductions, Review, and Motivation Learning Goals Review: Regression Models Exercises", " Topic 1 Introductions, Review, and Motivation Slides from today are available here. Learning Goals Understand the instances in which we care about causation more than association Review regression modeling and develop some ideas about its relation to causal inference goals Develop some ideas for why causal stories (i.e., expert knowledge) are crucial for causal inference goals Review: Regression Models Discuss the following questions with your group members. What does a linear regression model formula look like? If you covered logistic regression in STAT 155, what does a logistic regression model formula look like? When would you use logistic vs. linear regression? In general, how do we interpret the intercept in a regression model (both linear and logistic)? How do we interpret the other coefficients in a regression model (both linear and logistic)? How can we justify this interpretation mathematically? How might regression models be useful in understanding the causal effect of some variable on an outcome? Exercises You can download a template RMarkdown file to start from here. We will look at (simulated) data from a study that looked at the effectiveness of chemotherapy for treating colon cancer. Chemotherapy is effectively a poison that kills cells in the body that are rapidly proliferating: these cells include the cancer cells (often in a mass called a tumor) but also cells in bone marrow involved in sustaining the immune system. In this study, researchers measured the following variables: pre_tumor_size: Tumor size before the chemotherapy/placebo treatment (Small or Large). treated: ChemoYes if the patient received chemotherapy or ChemoNo if not. post_tumor_size: Tumor size 3 months after the chemotherapy/placebo treatment (Small or Large). recovery: Yes if the patient recovered from their cancer. No otherwise. You can read in the data as follows: chemo_study_data &lt;- read.csv(&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/vl06j75a8afw8ct/chemo_study.csv?dl=1&quot;) Exercise 1 The first step in any data analysis is to visualize your data. Let’s refamiliarize ourselves with the ggplot2 package in R. It may be helpful to have this ggplot2 cheat sheet open. Make sure to load the ggplot2 package by including library(ggplot2) at the top of your RMarkdown document. Look at the distribution of each of the 4 measured variables. What plot type is most appropriate for this type of variable? ggplot(chemo_study_data, aes(x = pre_tumor_size)) + ??? Is pre-treatment tumor size predictive of whether or not a patient received chemotherapy? Make a plot to assess this, and briefly state what conclusions can be drawn from the plot. (Hint: it will be helpful to look at the second page of the cheat sheet in the section labeled “Position Adjustments”.) ggplot(chemo_study_data, aes(x = pre_tumor_size, fill = treated)) + ??? Is pre-treatment tumor size predictive of whether or not a patient recovered? Make a plot, and briefly state your conclusions. A variable is a confounder if it is a common cause of both the treatment and outcome. This is shown in the diagram below. Given your results from parts b and c, could pre-treatment tumor size be a confounder of the relationship between chemotherapy treatment and recovery? If yes, what is the concern here? Note: the causal relationships of interest so far can be depicted in a causal diagram, shown below. An arrow between two variables indicates that one is a cause of the other (an arrow points from a cause to its effect). Exercise 2 One way to “adjust for” the influence of counfounders is to include them as predictors/explanatory variables in regression models. We can model recovery using a logistic regression model (used when the outcome variable is binary). In R, we can fit a logistic regression model using code like the following: # Fit the model and store it in the &quot;mod&quot; object mod &lt;- glm(outcome_variable ~ explanatory_variable1+explanatory_variable2, family = &quot;binomial&quot;, data = your_data) # Display model output summary(mod) Fit a logistic regression model with only treatment as a predictor. Interpret the treatment coefficient. Is this the interpretation you expected? Fit a logistic regression model with both treatment and pre-treatment tumor size as predictors. Interpret the treatment coefficient. Is this the interpretation you expected? Exercise 3 So far, we have not considered the post_tumor_size variable at all in our analyses. Let’s get some visual understanding of this variable. Make 2 plots: one showing its relationship with the treated variable and the second showing its relationship with the recovery variable. What is your intuition - should we include post_tumor_size as an explanatory variable in our logistic regression model? Why or why not? Fit the logistic regression model (mod3) with all 3 explanatory variables, and interpret the treatment coefficient. How do the results compare to mod2? The diagram that we considered at the end of Exercise 1 only included the treatment, recovery, and pre-treatment tumor size variables. Draw (on paper) an expanded causal diagram that includes post-treatment tumor size. In light of where post-treatment tumor size appears on your diagram, what does it mean to include it in the logistic regression model? The data in this investigation were simulated. That is, your instructor generated them, and thus, she actually knows the truth behind the data. The truth is that chemotherapy does have a true beneficial causal impact on recovery. Chemotherapy does increases the chance of recovery. Given this information and the insights you gained from these three exercises, try to put all of this information together. What makes sense? What remains unclear? "],

(\\(Z\\) is the set of variables being conditioned on.) \\(p\\) contains a chain of nodes \\(A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow C\\) or a fork \\(A \\leftarrow B \\rightarrow C\\) such that the middle node \\(B\\) is in \\(Z\\). \\(p\\) contains a collider \\(A \\rightarrow B \\leftarrow C\\) such that the collision node B is not in \\(Z\\), and no descendant of \\(B\\) is in \\(Z\\). If \\(Z\\) blocks every path between two nodes \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), then \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are d-separated, conditional on \\(Z\\), and are thus independent conditional on \\(Z\\). Discussion: The Birth Weight Paradox To facilitate our discussion, key pieces of information and terminology from the article are summarized below. Crude mortality rate ratio \\[\\frac{\\hbox{Infant mortality rate for maternal smokers}}{\\hbox{Infant mortality rate for maternal non-smokers}} = 1.55\\] Adjusted mortality rate ratio: same ratio but arising from a logistic regression model in which birth weight was held constant. This was 1.09. Stratum-specific mortality rate ratios In low birth weight infants: \\[\\frac{\\hbox{Infant mortality rate for maternal smokers}}{\\hbox{Infant mortality rate for maternal non-smokers}} = 0.79\\] In normal birth weight infants: \\[\\frac{\\hbox{Infant mortality rate for maternal smokers}}{\\hbox{Infant mortality rate for maternal non-smokers}} = 1.80\\] In your groups, discuss the following questions. Make sure to take good notes because the first post in your Portfolio will be a careful analysis of this paper. Throughout, remember that looking only at low birth weight infants amounts to conditioning on that variable. Using our knowledge of (in)dependence relations in DAGs, explain this quote about Figure 3.1 from the paper: “Under this scenario, the crude mortality rate ratio for smoking would be greater than 1, whereas the adjusted rate ratio and, equivalently, the stratum-specific rate ratios should be 1.” Explain why Figure 3.2 implies that the crude and adjusted mortality rate ratios would be the same. In Figure 3.5, the authors do not include an arrow from Smoking to Mortality, but they use this diagram to explain how the birth weight paradox could arise. Why is excluding this arrow a key part of their argumentation? Using Figure 3.5, explain how the paradox arises by using the ideas of d-separation. Figure 3.7 is the most realistic of the causal diagrams. Explain how the paradox arises in this setting. In Figure 3.7, would the paradox have arisen if LBW-Type A had been the selection criterion instead of LBW? Would the paradox have arisen if LBW-Type B had been the selection criterion? Let’s generalize the key findings in this paper. The term selection bias broadly describes bias in results due to the way in which study participants are selected. How did selection bias come about for the birth weight paradox? Can we generalize this occurrence in terms of more general graph properties? "],

In adjusting for variables in our analysis, we want to “do no harm”: Block non-causal paths that generate unwanted associations Do not accidentally create non-causal paths that generate unwanted associations Leave causal paths (chains) alone Example: Folic Acid and Birth Defects Does maternal folic acid supplementation reduce the risk of birth defects? Or could associations be due to confounding factors? What should we adjust for in our analysis? Example: Selection Bias See handout! Example: Estrogens and Uterine Cancer Does postmenopausal estrogen supplementation (hormone replacement therapy) cause uterine cancer? Consistent association between estrogen use and uterine cancer was noticed in the 1970s Two hypotheses: Estrogens do cause cancer Estrogens don’t cause cancer but lead to uterine bleeding, leading to more frequent doctor visits, leading to increased diagnosis of existing cancer Proposal for a study: restrict the study only to those with uterine bleeding and compare cancer rates in estrogen-users and non-users In this way, all participants have the same chance of being diagnosed. What could be wrong about this approach? Can we design a better study? Causal diagrams corresponding to the two hypotheses: Work through the following questions in your groups: Consider the study proposal: restrict analysis to those with uterine bleeding. Argue that under DAG 1, estrogens and diagnosed cancer will be associated. Argue that under DAG 2, estrogens and diagnosed cancer will be associated. Thus conclude that this study proposal cannot distinguish between the two competing hypotheses. Consider another study proposal: ensure that everyone is screened frequently, and we don’t restrict our analysis to only those with uterine bleeding. What arrow (in either DAG 1 or 2) can be removed as a result of this study design? In this study, say that we don’t find an association between estrogens and diagnosed cancer? What does this mean about paths from estrogens to diagnosed cancer? In this study, say that we do find an association between estrogens and diagnosed cancer? What does this mean about paths from estrogens to diagnosed cancer? Based on these investigations, make a conclusion about the quality of this study proposal as compared to the first. Principles of building causal diagrams A DAG is a causal DAG if it is common cause-complete: for any two variables in the DAG, common causes (whether measured or unmeasured) of those variables are shown. A causal DAG does NOT need to be cause-complete (infeasible due to infinite regress of causes). It should contain variables that are selected on, and subsequently common causes between those variables and existing variables. "],

Recall our principles for constructing causal DAGs: A DAG is a causal DAG if it is common cause-complete: for any two variables in the DAG, common causes (whether measured or unmeasured) of those variables are shown. A causal DAG does NOT need to be cause-complete (infeasible due to infinite regress of causes).

Discussion: Estimating causal effects In adjusting for variables in our analysis, we want to “do no harm”: Block non-causal paths that generate unwanted associations Do not accidentally create non-causal paths that generate unwanted associations Leave causal paths (chains) alone This was actually the rationale behind the backdoor criterion. (We’ll get back to this soon.) The do-operator One notion of causation is that of intervention: setting a variable’s value There is a difference between \\(P(Y \\mid A = a)\\) and \\(P(Y \\mid \\hbox{do}(A = a))\\). \\(P(Y \\mid A = a)\\) is an observational probability \\(P(Y \\mid \\hbox{do}(A = a))\\) is an intervention probability When we intervene on \\(A\\), this amounts to removing all arrows into \\(A\\). The do-operator allows us to graphically simulate interventions. In the world that was intervened on (manipulated), what do relationships between variables look like? Rules of probability combined with a set of graph rules (called the do-calculus) allow us to relate the relationships in the manipulated graph to relationships that we observe in the real world. \\[ \\hbox{Average causal effect} = P(Y = y \\mid \\hbox{do}(A = 1)) - P(Y = y \\mid \\hbox{do}(A = 0)) \\] \\(Y\\) is the outcome and \\(A\\) is the treatment (action) variable Taste of do-calculus next week. For now, let’s approach effect estimation from a different angle: The mathematical expressions in PRIMER for \\(P(y \\mid \\hbox{do}(a))\\) had something in common –&gt; let’s develop this idea and relate to something familiar: d-separation Worksheet: developing ideas Worksheet (with solutions) available here Notes: deriving inverse probability weighting If treatment \\(A\\) and outcome \\(Y\\) are d-separated given \\(Z\\) under the null (under the null hypothesis of no causal effect), then there are no open “spurious” paths generating unwanted associations between \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\). No open backdoor paths (paths with arrows into \\(A\\)): these generate confounding. No paths with collision nodes or descendants of collision nodes that are conditioned on: this opens paths that would otherwise be naturally blocked by the collision nodes. Then the outcomes of the treated and untreated are “comparable”. No open spurious paths. If the outcomes of the treated and untreated are “comparable”, then… We can upweight those treated to “create” a population where everyone was treated –&gt; look at outcome distributions in this population (e.g., \\(P(Y = 1)\\)). These weights are the inverse of \\(P(A = 1\\mid Z)\\). We can upweight those not treated to “create” a population where everyone was not treated –&gt; look at outcome distributions in this population (e.g., \\(P(Y = 1)\\)). These weights are the inverse of \\(P(A = 0\\mid Z)\\). These outcome distributions are actually interpreted as: All treated: \\(P(Y = 1 \\mid \\hbox{do}(A = 1))\\) All not treated: \\(P(Y = 1 \\mid \\hbox{do}(A = 0))\\) Note: we have appealed to what it conceptually means to do/intervene. We haven’t done any “graph surgery”. \\[ \\hbox{Average causal effect} = \\hbox{ACE} = P(Y = 1 \\mid \\hbox{do}(A = 1)) - P(Y = 1 \\mid \\hbox{do}(A = 0)) \\] If ACE = 0.1, interpreted as: The probability of recovery (\\(Y = 1\\)) is 10% higher if we treat everyone, as compared to if we treat no one. The individual “do” probabilities are actually weighted averages of the outcome variable: \\[ P(Y = 1 \\mid \\hbox{do}(A = a)) = \\frac{\\sum_i w_i y_i}{\\sum_i w_i} \\] \\(w_i\\) is the appropriate weight for case \\(i\\) \\(y_i\\) is the outcome for case \\(i\\) The sum is over all treated for \\(a = 1\\) and over all untreated for \\(a = 0\\). Punchline: If treatment \\(A\\) and outcome \\(Y\\) are d-separated given \\(Z\\) under the null, we can estimate desired “do” probabilities with \\[ P(Y = 1 \\mid \\hbox{do}(A = a)) = \\frac{\\sum_i w_i y_i}{\\sum_i w_i} \\] where the weights \\(w_i\\) are the inverse propensity scores: \\(w_i = 1/P(A = 1 \\mid Z)\\) if \\(a = 1\\) \\(w_i = 1/P(A = 0 \\mid Z)\\) if \\(a = 0\\) When \\(Z\\) contains many variables, we can’t tabulate as we did by hand (too many combinations of predictor levels relative to our sample size). Need to model treatment as a function of the variables in \\(Z\\). Logistic regression Other techniques from Statistical Machine Learning Exercise: Simulation planning Goal: Plan (then implement) a simulation that shows that inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to estimate average causal effects gives the same results as using the do-operator. This will be done in the context of the DAG below. Plan: As you go through this planning, think about what code you would have to write (in broad terms) and the order in which you would have to run those commands. For this exercise, don’t look at the code below. We’ll get to it next. Phase 1: How would you simulate the DAG below? (All variables binary.) How would you simulate new versions of Y under the manipulated graphs resulting from do(A = 1) and do(A = 0)? How would you compute the average causal effect from do-ing? Phase 2: How would you estimate the propensity score for each individual? How would you estimate P(Y = 1 | do(A = 1)) and P(Y = 1 | do(A = 0)) using those estimated propensity scores? After your planning phase, step through the code in the section below, and make sure that you understand what each line is doing. Clarify with the instructor as needed.

Take a careful look at the probabilities used to generate the treatment \\(A\\), and re-examine the form of your propensity score model. Thinking about what the coefficients mean in your propensity score (PS) model, what would you need to do to improve your propensity score model? Fit this new PS model as ps_mod2. Add a second PS variable PS2, and create a corresponding weight2 variable. Store the results from both PS models with something similar to below, Display the estimated ACE resulting from both models. results &lt;- sim_data %&gt;% group_by(A) %&gt;% summarize( Y_po_estim1 = sum(Y*weight1)/sum(weight1), Y_po_estim2 = sum(Y*weight2)/sum(weight2) ) Repeat this simulation using numbers for p_A that make the simpler PS model valid. As before, show the results of both the simpler and more complex PS model. "],
["ip-weighting-in-practice.html", "Topic 6 IP weighting in practice Learning Goals Discussion Analysis", " Topic 6 IP weighting in practice Learning Goals Practice an analysis workflow from start to finish Formulate generalized causal research questions using marginal structural models Interpret results from fitting MSMs Discussion Last time, we derived the following result: If treatment \\(A\\) and outcome \\(Y\\) are d-separated given \\(Z\\) under the null, we can estimate desired “do” probabilities with a weighted average of the outcomes: \\[ P(Y = 1 \\mid \\hbox{do}(A = a)) = \\frac{\\sum_i w_i y_i}{\\sum_i w_i} \\] where the weights \\(w_i\\) are the inverse propensity scores: \\(w_i = 1/P(A = 1 \\mid Z)\\) if \\(a = 1\\) \\(w_i = 1/P(A = 0 \\mid Z)\\) if \\(a = 0\\) When \\(Z\\) contains many variables, we need to model treatment as a function of the variables in \\(Z\\) to obtain estimates of the propensity scores. Can use: Logistic regression Other techniques from Statistical Machine Learning In particular, this weighted average \\[ P(Y = 1 \\mid \\hbox{do}(A = a)) = \\frac{\\sum_i w_i y_i}{\\sum_i w_i} \\] is specific to the situation where \\(Y\\) is a binary outcome variable, and we want to know \\(P(Y = 1)\\) (which also happens to be equal to the expected value of \\(Y\\): \\(E[Y] = P(Y = 1)\\)). Inverse probability weighting works more generally: Treatment \\(A\\) does not have to be binary A continuous treatment is generally difficult to work with Categorical treatments with 3+ categories are naturally handled with extensions of logistic regression (e.g., multinomial regression, other statistical machine learning methods) Outcome \\(Y\\) does not have to be binary Recall from our tree diagrams that inverse probability weighting (see our worksheet with solutions here) upweights the treated to create a population where everyone had been treated upweights the untreated to create a population where everyone had been untreated In these two populations, we counted up the number of instances where \\(Y=1\\) to obtain our “do” probabilities of interest. In essence, the IP weighting created these populations of all treated and all untreated. Considered together, these two populations are called a pseudopopulation because everyone exists twice (as a treated and as an untreated individual). In this pseudopopulation, we essentially fit the simple logistic regression model: \\[ \\log\\hbox{odds}(Y = 1) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 A \\] So in summary: we fit a logistic regression model using inverse probability weights. Each individual received the appropriate \\(1/P(A=1\\mid Z)\\) or \\(1/P(A=0\\mid Z)\\) weight. Normally with ordinary unweighted logistic regression, every individual receives a weight of 1. (They appear exactly once in the dataset.) We can make this idea more general: The inverse probability weights effectively repeat certain individuals a number of times so that their data “represents” the other individuals who had received another value of the treatment variable. The IP weights create the pseudopopulation where each individual receives every version of the treatment variable. We can fit any model we want (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression) in this pseudopopulation to relate the outcome to the treatment variable. The process of fitting such a model (i.e., fitting a standard regression model supplemented with IP weights) is the process of fitting marginal structural models New notation: The \\(Y\\) that results when we \\(\\hbox{do}(A=1)\\) can also be notated as \\(Y^{a=1}\\), called the potential outcome under treatment. The \\(Y\\) that results when we \\(\\hbox{do}(A=0)\\) can also be notated as \\(Y^{a=0}\\), called the potential outcome under no treatment. In general the potential outcome when we \\(\\hbox{do}(A=a)\\) is denoted \\(Y^a\\). In words, this potential outcome means: “the outcome that would result if we intervened to set \\(A=a\\)” A marginal structural model (MSM) is a model that relates potential outcomes \\(Y^a\\) to the treatment variable (as opposed to the naturally observed outcomes \\(Y\\)): A linear regression MSM for continuous/quantitative outcomes \\(Y\\): \\[ E[Y^a] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 a \\] A logistic regression MSM for binary outcomes \\(Y\\): \\[ \\log\\left( \\frac{P(Y^a = 1)}{1-P(Y^a = 1)} \\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 a \\] Where does the name “marginal structural model” come from? Marginal: refers to the fact that the marginal mean (as opposed to a conditional mean, which is a mean in a subgroup) is being modeled (much like how it’s used in “marginally dependent/independent”) Structural: In general models in causal inference that describe potential outcomes are referred to as “structural” to indicate a describing of relationships beyond only associations Analysis A template Rmd is available here.

Research goal: What is the average causal effect of smoking cessation on weight gain at a follow-up visit about 10 years later? Part 1: Getting a feel for the data Tabulate the treatment variable qsmk, visualize the outcome variable, and get summary statistics for the outcome variable. How many missing values are there for these variables? What key implication does this have for our DAG? # Tabulate with the count() function from dplyr # count() does show NAs, if present nhefs %&gt;% count(qsmk) # Construct a visualization of the weight gain variable # Summary statistics for the weight gain variable summary(nhefs$wt82_71) We will need to exclude cases with missing data for the outcome. Work with the nhefs_subs for the remainder of this analysis: nhefs_subs &lt;- nhefs %&gt;% filter(!is.na(wt82_71)) Let’s look at the variable distributions within the treated (qsmk = 1: the quitters) and the untreated (qsmk = 0). # Here we enumerate the quantitative and the categorical variables quant_vars &lt;- c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;alcoholhowmuch&quot;, &quot;cholesterol&quot;, &quot;ht&quot;, &quot;pregnancies&quot;, &quot;price71&quot;, &quot;smokeintensity&quot;, &quot;smokeyrs&quot;, &quot;tax71&quot;, &quot;wt71&quot;) categ_vars &lt;- c(&quot;active&quot;, &quot;alcoholfreq&quot;, &quot;alcoholpy&quot;, &quot;alcoholtype&quot;, &quot;allergies&quot;, &quot;asthma&quot;, &quot;boweltrouble&quot;, &quot;bronch&quot;, &quot;chroniccough&quot;, &quot;colitis&quot;, &quot;diabetes&quot;, &quot;education&quot;, &quot;exercise&quot;, &quot;hayfever&quot;, &quot;hbp&quot;, &quot;hbpmed&quot;, &quot;headache&quot;, &quot;hepatitis&quot;, &quot;hf&quot;, &quot;hightax82&quot;, &quot;income&quot;, &quot;infection&quot;, &quot;lackpep&quot;, &quot;marital&quot;, &quot;nerves&quot;, &quot;nervousbreak&quot;, &quot;otherpain&quot;, &quot;pepticulcer&quot;, &quot;pica&quot;, &quot;polio&quot;, &quot;race&quot;, &quot;school&quot;, &quot;sex&quot;, &quot;tb&quot;, &quot;tumor&quot;, &quot;weakheart&quot;, &quot;wtloss&quot;) # Compare the means of the quantitative variables in the treated and untreated nhefs_subs %&gt;% group_by(qsmk) %&gt;% summarize_at(.vars = quant_vars, .funs = mean) %&gt;% as.data.frame() # Compare the distributions of the categorical variables in the treated and untreated # First row numbers are P(covariate | qsmk=0) # Second row numbers are P(covariate | qsmk=1) for (c_var in categ_vars) { cat(c_var, &quot;:\\n&quot;) table(qsmk = nhefs_subs$qsmk, nhefs_subs[[c_var]], useNA = &quot;ifany&quot;) %&gt;% prop.table(margin = 1) %&gt;% print() cat(&quot;\\n&quot;) } How could you use these data summaries to help with DAG construction (coming next)? Part 2: Causal DAG construction Building the causal DAG from start to finish would normally be a much longer process. So that we can get to the data analysis practice, we’ll abbreviate this crucial step. We’ll start with the following d-separating set: sex age race education smokeintensity smokeyrs active exercise wt71 Open up the web version of DAGitty, which we’ll use to draw our causal diagram. In the top menu bar, click “Model” &gt; “New model”. Also go through the “How to …” Add the treatment and outcome nodes as well as the above variables. Also add the relevant edges. Looking briefly through the codebook and your data summaries above, do you think that there are other key variables to include in the DAG? There is potential selection bias at play. (There were missing values for the response variable.) Add a selection node and give it the “adjusted” status (under the left “Variable” menu). What factors do you think are related to not showing up for the second study visit (and thus not having weight gain measured)? Based on this add edges between the selection node and other variables. What is your d-separating set? So that you can come back to your DAG easily, copy and paste the “Model code” in the right side menu into a separate text document. Part 3: Propensity score modeling In order to fit marginal structural models (MSMs) that allow us to estimate average causal effects, we need to estimate the propensity scores. Make visualizations to inform the nature of the relationship between treatment and the quantitative predictors. For example, you can use code like the following to see if the observed probabilities (in blue) match up with those predicted by a logistic regression model with a quadratic function of age (in red). The y~poly(x,2) could be changed to y~x to see the results of having age linearly related to the log odds of treatment. State your conclusions from these visualizations. ggplot(nhefs, aes(x = age, y = qsmk)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = &quot;loess&quot;, se = FALSE, color = &quot;blue&quot;) + geom_smooth(formula = y~poly(x,2), method=&quot;glm&quot;, method.args=list(family=&quot;binomial&quot;), se = FALSE, color = &quot;red&quot;) Based on your visualizations, construct an appropriate propensity score model. To include polynomial relationships in the model you can use +poly(age, 2), for example, in the model formula. Compute the estimated propensity scores and inverse probability weights as we did in our simulations. Call the weight variable weight1. Here you’ll want to check if nhefs_subs$qsmk==1 or nhefs_subs$qsmk==0. Store the IP weights in your nhefs_subs dataset. Part 4: Fitting marginal structural models Install the geepack package which we’ll be using to fit MSMs. This package fits linear and logistic regression models like lm() and glm() do, but it uses a better estimate of the standard error in the presence of weights. The code below fits the MSM: \\[ E[Y^a] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\hbox{qsmk} \\] library(geepack) msm_fit1 &lt;- geeglm( wt82_71 ~ qsmk, data = nhefs_subs, weights = weight1, id = seqn, corstr = &quot;independence&quot; ) summary(msm_fit1) Interpret both the intercept and qsmk coefficients. Confidence intervals are not displayed in the output, so we’ll compute them by hand. (p-values are displayed, but it’ll be nice to have confidence intervals because they nicely convey both the estimate itself and its uncertainty.) The coefficient estimates are expected to be normally distributed with mean equal to the true population value and standard deviation equal to the standard error. Use the qnorm() function to obtain the 95% confidence interval for the qsmk coefficient. Summarize your results from this analysis. Adapt the above code to fit an effect modification MSM: \\[ E[Y^a] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\,\\hbox{qsmk} + \\beta_2\\,\\hbox{sex} + \\beta_3\\,\\hbox{qsmk}\\times \\hbox{sex} \\] Interpret both the qsmk and interaction coefficients. Compute confidence intervals for those coefficients, and summarize your results. "],

Depends on research goals, but yes, sometimes ACE is of interest. Is it a nationwide policy? If so, then enacting the policy means “treating” everyone and not enacting means treating no one. May care about the ACE within subgroups. We’ve seen this with effect modification MSMs: \\[ E[Y^a] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 a + \\beta_2 M + \\beta_3 a\\times M \\] Say \\(M\\) indicates history of heart disease (1: history. 0: no history) Question: What are the interpretation of \\(\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\beta_3\\) in this model? What is the difference between regular and IP-weighted GLMs? Our tree diagrams showed that weighting allows us to create “populations” of all treated and all untreated. Our WHATIF book calls the combined population of the all treated and the all untreated a pseudopopulation We can model the outcomes in this pseudopopulation with standard regression models (marginal structural models). Allows us to estimate causal quantities: \\(P(Y \\mid \\hbox{do}(A=a))\\), \\(E[Y \\mid \\hbox{do}(A=a)]\\) (in potential outcome notation: \\(P(Y^a)\\), \\(E[Y^a]\\)) Standard regression models without IP weights do not estimate these causal quantities. Censoring and selection bias Reminder: NHEFS investigation from last time Research goal: What is the average causal effect of smoking cessation on weight gain at a follow-up visit about 10 years later? There were some people who did not have their weight measured at Visit 2. They must be excluded from our analysis. Define a censoring indicator \\(C\\) where \\(C = 1\\) means censored/excluded and \\(C = 0\\) means uncensored/included. Our analysis only generalizes to uncensored individuals–the types of people who would stay in the study! Before: just wanted to find \\(Z\\) such that conditional on \\(Z\\) (within subsets defined by \\(Z\\)), the outcomes of the treated and untreated were comparable. Could appropriately upweight the treated and untreated to get “populations” of all treated and all untreated. Now: also want to ensure that the outcomes in the censored and uncensored are comparable. Can appropriately upweight the uncensored to represent everyone had they not been censored. The censored get zero weight. (We don’t observe them!) When are the outcomes in the censored and uncensored comparable? When variables in \\(A\\) and \\(Z_2\\) together d-separate \\(C\\) and the outcome \\(Y\\). e.g., The DAG below. View \\(C\\) as the new “treatment” variable. Another way to put it: when we put a box around \\(C\\) in the DAG, \\(Z\\) must d-separate \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\) under the null. Same condition as before, now explicit about paths with conditioned-on colliders (non-backdoor paths). Questions: \\(C\\) is inherently conditioned on in our analysis (\\(C = 0\\)). What set \\(Z\\) d-separates the treatment and outcome under the null? What is a set \\(Z_2\\) such that \\(Z_2 \\cup A\\) (read \\(Z_2\\) “union” \\(A\\), or \\(Z_2\\) and \\(A\\) together) d-separate \\(C\\) and the outcome? Conclusion: \\(Z\\) should include: sex, age, race, education, smokeintensity, smokeyrs, active, exercise, wt71, and VidGames (Same as before with the addition of VidGames) \\(Z\\) blocks spurious, non-causal paths between \\(A\\) (qsmk) and \\(Y\\) (wt82_71) \\(Z_2\\) should include VidGames Together with \\(A\\), \\(Z_2\\) blocks spurious, non-causal paths between \\(C\\) and \\(Y\\) Note that \\(Z_2\\) is contained within \\(Z\\). This will be the case when \\(A\\) is a cause of \\(C\\) (often true). Ultimate goal: Want to upweight individuals using \\(P(A, C = 0 \\mid Z)\\) Why? Same rationale as our tree diagram with additional \\(C = 1\\) and \\(C = 0\\) branches. Allows us to estimate \\(E[Y^{a, c = 0}]\\): expected potential outcome under treatment \\(a\\) and when no one has been censored (\\(C = 0\\)) We can express \\(P(A, C = 0 \\mid Z)\\) as the following: \\[ \\begin{align*} P(A, C = 0 \\mid Z) &amp;= P(A, C = 0, Z)/P(Z) \\\\ &amp;= P(A \\mid Z) P(C = 0 \\mid A, Z) \\end{align*} \\] Based on the last line, we see (1) the propensity score and (2) another “propensity” of being uncensored. Will want models for both. (The censoring probability is not typically called a propensity score.) A little extra theory (don’t worry about the math part below if you haven’t taken Probability): \\(Z\\) may contain extra variables not in \\(Z_2\\) if there are, say, many common causes of \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\), but only a few of these are a cause of \\(C\\). Let’s say that these extra variables are in the set \\(Z_1\\). (\\(Z = Z_1 \\cup Z_2\\)) If the variables in \\(Z_1\\) are not causes of \\(C\\), then \\(C\\) and \\(Z_1\\) are conditionally independent given \\(A\\) and \\(Z_2\\). Going through the work below… \\[ \\begin{align*} P(A, C = 0 \\mid Z) &amp;= P(A, C = 0 \\mid Z_1, Z_2) \\\\ &amp;= P(A, C = 0, Z_1, Z_2)/P(Z_1, Z_2) \\\\ &amp;= P(A \\mid Z_1, Z_2) P(C = 0 \\mid A, Z_1, Z_2) \\\\ &amp;= P(A \\mid Z_1, Z_2) P(C = 0 \\mid A, Z_2) \\end{align*} \\] …this implies that the propensity score model (for \\(A\\)) should depend on all variables in \\(Z\\) (the set \\(Z_1\\) and \\(Z_2\\) together) and that the censoring probability model only need depend on \\(Z_2\\). Analysis plan: Notation: \\(Z\\) is the set that d-separates \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\) when \\(C\\) is conditioned on. \\(Z_2\\) (a subset of \\(Z\\)) that, together with \\(A\\), d-separates \\(C\\) and \\(Y\\) Model the propensity scores \\(P(A\\mid Z)\\) using all variables \\(Z\\) in the d-separating set. Create inverse probability weights \\(W^A = 1/P(A\\mid Z)\\) (treatment weights). Model the probability of censoring \\(P(C \\mid A, Z_2)\\). Create inverse probability weights \\(W^C = 1/P(C = 0\\mid A, Z_2)\\) (censoring weights). Create final weights (for treatment and censoring) \\(W^{A,C} = W^A\\times W^C\\).

Exercises Exercise 1 The SGS algorithm will find the correct equivalence class of graphs but is quite slow. We’ll build up the ideas underlying a faster algorithm, the PC algorithm (stands for Peter-Clark). Consider the testing of whether or not two variables are conditionally independent. How would you expect the computing time of this test to change as the variable set being conditioned on increases? Explain. Recall the edge deletion step of SGS: For every pair of variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) and all other sets \\(Z\\) of other variables, check if we can make \\(X \\perp \\!\\!\\! \\perp Y \\mid Z\\). If so, remove the edge between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). What strategies might we employ to make this step faster? What might be a better order in which to test these sets \\(Z\\)? What statistical advantages are linked to the better order you decided on in (b)? Think in terms of statistical power. Exercise 2 It’ll be handy to have the TETRAD manual open. Phase 1: Simulate data for a chain X -&gt; Y -&gt; Z and for a collider X -&gt; Y &lt;- Z. For each, write the data to a CSV file using the following. (Assuming that you will save this data in a folder called tetrad.) write.csv(sim_data, file = &quot;tetrad/chain_binary.csv&quot;) write.csv(sim_data, file = &quot;tetrad/collider_binary.csv&quot;) Phase 2: Exploration of TETRAD functionality as a class. Phase 3: In groups, explore select aspects of the parameters window: Collider discovery: experiment with options 2 (CPC, the default) and 3 (Max-P) Cutoff for p-values Exercise 3 There are two genes (Gene A and Gene B) that produce Protein X. Gene A is the primary producer. Whenever Gene A is functional, Gene B is inactive and produces nothing. However, if Gene A loses function, Gene B becomes active and produces Protein X in Gene A’s place in exactly the same amounts. Draw the DAG implied by this expert knowledge. We can view Gene A as a binary variable with values “functional” and “non-functional”. Will Gene A and Protein X be marginally independent or marginally dependent in the data? Discuss your answers to (a) and (b) in the context of a relevant concept. Exercise 4 In this exercise, we’ll think about the conditional independence test and the role of the p-value cutoff parameter. In what phase(s) of causal discovery algorithms do we need to test for conditional (in)dependence? These conditional independence tests need to test statements of the form: \\(X \\perp \\!\\!\\! \\perp Y \\mid Z\\). Describe how regression models could test this. Make sure to clearly describe the null hypothesis. As the p-value cutoff is lowered to 0, what would you expect to happen to the graph pattern learned by causal discovery algorithms? As the p-value cutoff is increased to 1? Exercise 5 The algorithms we’ve discussed so far are called constraint-based methods because they test conditional independence constraints. Another class of methods are called score-based methods. Read over a description of the Greedy Equivalence Search algorithm here, and provide a high-level overview of how the algorithm works in your own words. Exercise 6 Consider data that truly come from a chain X -&gt; Y -&gt; Z. Step through the full causal discovery algorithm and report the output that it would give. Suppose you could give background knowledge on just one edge that is required to be present. (Perhaps you have temporal information on those variables.) What edge would allow the entire structure to be learned? Exercise 7 Consider data that truly come from a fork X &lt;- Y -&gt; Z. What output would a causal discovery algorithm give? What type of background information could be given to help uncover the true structure? A required edge? Temporal information? Exercise 8 The PC algorithm assumes that the set of observed variables is the complete set present in the graph. That is, it assumes no unmeasured (latent) variables. How could we modify the PC algorithm to account for latent variables? "],

We’ll create a binary unmeasured variable \\(U\\) that has varying degrees of association with both \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\). Add extra comments throughout the code to better document this implementation of a sensitivity analysis. Complete the sensitivity analysis by completing the TASK referred to within the for-loop. # Create a vector of possible associations that U has with A and Y U_assocs &lt;- seq(0.05,2,0.1) # Create empty storage containers to store the new ACEs and CI bounds new_aces &lt;- rep(0, length(U_assocs)) new_ci_upper &lt;- rep(0, length(U_assocs)) new_ci_lower &lt;- rep(0, length(U_assocs)) # Loop over possible values of the association for (i in seq_along(U_assocs)) { U_assoc &lt;- U_assocs[i] log_odds_U &lt;- U_assoc*sim_data$Y + U_assoc*sim_data$A p_U &lt;- exp(log_odds_U)/(1+exp(log_odds_U)) U &lt;- rbinom(n, size = 1, prob = p_U) sim_data$U &lt;- U # TASK: Fit the new MSM that accounts for U new_msm_fit &lt;- ??? # Store relevant values new_aces[i] &lt;- summary(new_msm_fit)$coefficients[&quot;A&quot;, &quot;Estimate&quot;] se &lt;- summary(new_msm_fit)$coefficients[&quot;A&quot;, &quot;Std.err&quot;] new_ci_upper[i] &lt;- new_aces[i]+(qnorm(0.975)*se) new_ci_lower[i] &lt;- new_aces[i]-(qnorm(0.975)*se) } Below we plot the results of this sensitivity analysis. The black line shows the different ACEs, and the ribbon shows the corresponding 95% confidence interval. The red line shows the original ACE estimate. What information can be gained from this plot? What is the smallest magnitude of association with \\(U\\) that leads to qualitatively different conclusions? Look back to where we simulated \\(Y\\).

How could these sensitivity analyses be used for assessing the impact of even more general structures of unmeasured confounding? "],
["homework-1.html", "Homework 1 Conceptual Exercises Simulation Exercises Portfolio", " Homework 1 Due Thursday, February 13 in class Conceptual Exercises These exercises can be turned in on paper in class. Exercise 1 We have looked at 3 DAG structures (chains, forks, and colliders) and claimed that they are the building blocks of all DAGs. Is this true? We will verify this premise in this exercise. Let’s start by considering all possible directed (not necessarily acyclic) graphs with 3 variables. (Three is the smallest number of nodes where any interesting structures can arise.) There are 27 of these graphs. Draw all of these graphs with the aid of the expand.grid() function in R. First, look up the documentation for this function. Second, run the command below to get a sense for how the function can help you. For this part, display the 27 graphs, and provide a brief explanation of how expand.grid() helped. expand.grid( X_to_Y = c(&quot;-&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;-&quot;, &quot;absent&quot;), Y_to_Z = c(&quot;-&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;-&quot;, &quot;absent&quot;), X_to_Z = c(&quot;-&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;-&quot;, &quot;absent&quot;) ) From your list of graphs, indicate which graphs can be eliminated because they are cyclic. From your list of graphs, indicate which graphs can be eliminated because they are useless causal models. In your list of graphs, some graphs are essentially the same. Group these together, and draw one representative graph from each group. Briefly form a conclusion based on these investigations. Exercise 2 PRIMER, Study question 2.3.1: Parts (c), (e), and (f). For parts (e) and (f), explain your thinking. Exercise 3 PRIMER, Study question 2.4.1: Parts (a), (b), and (c). For part (b), only d-separate pairs of non-adjacent measured variables. Simulation Exercises On Moodle, turn these exercises in by submitting both your Rmd file and the knitted HTML. For these exercises, ensure that your plots are well-labeled. Add the following to the ends of your plots to label your plots accurately: + labs(x = &quot;x axis label&quot;, y = &quot;y axis label&quot;, title = &quot;overall plot title&quot;) A refresher on facet_grid() that may be useful: To form panels across columns by variable Y: + facet_grid(~ Y) To form a grid of panels where rows correspond to X and columns to Y: + facet_grid(X ~ Y) To form a grid of panels where rows correspond to X and columns to Y and Z: + facet_grid(X ~ Y+Z) In case you’re curious about how to change the labeling of facet titles, see here. (Optional) You may or may not find it helpful/enjoyable to use the gridExtra package for arranging your plots. Example use case: library(gridExtra) p1 &lt;- ggplot(...) # Plot 1 p2 &lt;- ggplot(...) # Plot 2 p3 &lt;- ggplot(...) # Plot 3 p4 &lt;- ggplot(...) # Plot 4 # To arrange the 4 plots in a 2x2 grid: grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol = 2, nrow = 2) If you look at your knitted HTML and think that your plots are too small, you can change the beginning of your code chunks to the following (playing with the numbers as needed): ```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=5} Exercise 4 Simulate data for a chain X -&gt; Y -&gt; Z where all variables are binary. Make plots to show the following properties: X and Z are marginally dependent X and Z are conditionally independent given Y Clearly explain how the plots show the dependence or independence. When you use dplyr::case_when() to generate probabilities that depend on another single variable, will any set of numbers work? Explain. Give an example of a set of numbers that would not generate the desired results. Exercise 5 Simulate data for a fork Y &lt;- X -&gt; Z where all variables are binary. Make plots to show the following properties: Y and Z are marginally dependent Y and Z are conditionally independent given X Exercise 6 Simulate data for a collider X -&gt; Z &lt;- Y where all variables are binary. Make plots to show the following properties: X and Y are marginally independent X and Y are conditionally dependent given Z When you use dplyr::case_when() to generate probabilities that depend on two variables, will any set of numbers work? Explain. Give an example of a set of numbers that would not generate the desired results. Exercise 7 Simulate data corresponding to the causal diagram in Figure 2.8 of PRIMER. Ignore the U variables (error terms) in the diagram, and treat all variables (T, Z, W, X, Y, and U) as binary. Make plots to show the following properties, and explain why they hold using the rules of d-separation: Z and Y are marginally dependent Z and Y are conditionally independent given T Z and Y are conditionally dependent given T and W Z and Y are conditionally independent given T, W, and X Portfolio Work on a draft post for required topic #1 (the birth weight paradox).

If you are keen on building your own website, you could publish these posts there as a part of building up an online presence. This is certainly not a requirement for class though. How you organize and structure your posts is up to you, but they need to address the topics below. Required Topics (This list will grow as the semester progresses.) An analysis of the article The Birth Weight “Paradox” Uncovered? at the level of detail of our in-class discussion. The post does not have to answer the exact same discussion questions posed in class. The post should explain the paradox and what the authors did to investigate it. This should include a discussion of how they proceeded through the various causal diagrams and why some were eliminated. The post should explain how the authors resolved the paradox in the most realistic causal diagrams. The post should conclude with general lessons learned from this example. Iterative Progress You will work on these posts iteratively throughout the semester. The homework assignments will give deadlines for when a rough draft is due. Although writing rough drafts will be part of your homework duties, the drafts will not be part of your homework grade. You will only receive qualitative feedback from me on your drafts. This will be the process for writing and feedback for the semester: Create one (and only one) new Google Doc. This will be where all of your drafts go. Enable link sharing so that those with the link can edit. Submit the link on Moodle &gt; Homework &gt; Portfolio Google Doc Link. Start writing! In the days after draft due dates, I will be reading your drafts and giving feedback by a fixed time. You are welcome to revise based on my feedback as many times as you want. When you would like another round of feedback, add a comment to the relevant section and tag me in it to bring it to my attention. (Type a “+” in the comment box followed by my email address.)
